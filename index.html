          <h1>Biography</h1>
          <p>
            Luis Lionel Andres (“Leo”) Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who
            plays forward for the FC Barcelona club and the Argentina national
            team. At the age of 13, Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC
            Barcelona agreed to pay for his medical treatments.
          </p>
          <p>
            There he earned renown as one of the greatest players in history,
            helping his club win more than two dozen league titles and
            tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a calendar
            year, and in 2019, he was named Europe's Ballon d'Or winner for the
            sixth time.
          </p>

          <h2>Early Life</h2>
          <p>
            Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young
            boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer
            with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys. At the age of
            8, he was recruited to join the youth system of Newell's Old Boys, a
            Rosario-based club.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizably smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi
            was eventually diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone
            deficiency that restricted his growth. Messi's parents, Jorge and
            Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth-hormone injections
            for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several
            hundred dollars per month for the medication.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, at the age of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at
            soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have
            his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and
            moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. Although he
            was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through
            the junior system ranks. Ultimately, Messi's short stature (5 feet,
            7 inches), combined with his speed and relentless attacking style,
            has drawn comparisons to another famous Argentinian footballer,
            Diego Maradona.
          </p>

          <h2>Professional Career</h2>
          <p>
            Messi has only played for FC Barcelona, where he first signed at age
            13. He also plays for the Argentina national team.
          </p>

          <p>
            By the age of 16, Messi made his first appearance for the FC
            Barcelona, putting himself in the record books on May 1, 2005, as
            the youngest player to ever score a goal for the franchise. That
            same year, he led Argentina to the title in the under-20 World Cup,
            scoring on a pair of penalty kicks to propel the team over Nigeria.
          </p>

          <p>
            Messi steered Barcelona to a wealth of success, most notably in
            2009, when the left-footer's team captured the Champions League, La
            Liga, and Spanish Super Cup titles. That same year, after two
            consecutive runner-up finishes, he took home his first FIFA "World
            Player of the Year" honor/Ballon d'Or award.
          </p>
          <p>
            The soccer great came back to earth somewhat that year due to the
            persistence of hamstring injuries, but he regained his
            record-breaking form by becoming the all-time leading scorer in La
            Liga and Champions League play in late 2014.
          </p>
          <p>
            After helping Barcelona achieve a historic second treble in 2015, he
            was honored with his fifth FIFA Ballon d'Or trophy. Four years
            later, following another La Liga title, Messi again established a
            new standard for excellence by claiming his sixth Ballon d'Or.

              The forward added to his 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2019
              trophies after winning the Copa America for the first time with
              his country last July.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It's incredible to be here again. Two years ago I thought it was
              the last time. Winning the Copa America was key," Messi said at
              Paris's Theatre du Chatelet.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It is a special year for me with this Copa America title. It
              meant a lot to win at the Maracana stadium and I was so happy to
              celebrate with the people from Argentina.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I don't know if it's the best year of my life, I've had a long
              career, but it was a special one with the title with Argentina
              after the tough times and the criticism."
